gsmcard is a sim card manager.
It can save and restore the phone book, change and unblock pin codes.


|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                REQUIREMENTS                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- A sim card reader with driver. A normal smartcard reader might
  work if you have (or build) a card holder.
- The PCSC stack (see http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html) 
- The perl library ChipCard::PCSC and libpcsc-perl
  (see http://search.cpan.org/~whom/pcsc-perl/)

Most linux distributions already provide packages for these things; eg.
for debian running
	
	apt-get install libpcsc-perl

should be sufficient for the libraries; for a list of smartcard reader
drivers please look at 
  http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=pcsc+lib&searchon=all&suite=unstable&section=all


|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                INSTALLATION                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Copy the gsmcard.pl script wherever you want.
- Change mode on the script to set it executable.


|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                               GENERAL INFO                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The sim cards normally know 4 PINs; these are named "pin" (or "pin1"), "pin2",
"puk", and "puk2."

- PIN can be required to unlock the sim card, in order to access the
  phone book or use it in a mobile phone.
- The puk can be used to reset the pin.
- pin2 and puk2 are used to unlock payment options.

|                                   USAGE                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Launch the script in a terminal. A prompt is now waiting for your commands.
  Here are the available commands and descriptions. All parameters can be
  entered with the command or will be asked interactively by gsmcard.

  Please don't worry about the 3-digit status codes that are printed before
  each answer; these provide an FTP-like protocol for GUI applications.

- First, you might want to get additional inline help with the 'help'
  command.

  > help (ask for general help)
  > help opencard (same as above but on a specific command, here 'opencard')

- Then, if you want to interact with a sim card, you need to use the
  'opencard' command that will open a communication channel with the sim
  card. Note that you might have to enter the pin code, if the sim card
  is configured to require it.

  > opencard (open the communication channel with the sim card)
  > opencard 1234 (same as above but specifying a pin code)

- If you want to check the status of the sim card and the communication
  channel between gsmcard and the sim card, use the 'status' command.

  > status (get status of sim card and communication channel)

- If you want to get some various information about the sim card, you can use
  the 'info' command with one of the following parameters depending on what
  informations you want to get: serial, lang, imsi or sp.

  > info serial (get serial number of the sim card)
  > info lang (get language informations of the sim card)
  > info imsi (get internal mobile subscriber id of the sim card)
  > info sp (get service provider of the sim card)

- When you have finished working with the sim card, you can close the
  communication channel with the 'closecard' command.

  > closecard

- If you want to quit gsmcard, you can use the 'quit' command. Note that the
  'quit' command does a 'closecard' automatically, if needed.

  > quit

- If you want to give the pin code (in order to access data contained in the
  sim card), you can use the 'givepin' command to specify the pin code.
  You can specify whether to use pin or pin2; normally you'll want to use 
  the pin, this is the default.

  > give pin 1234 (give primary pin code)
  > give pin 1234 2 (same as aboce but for secondary pin code)

- If you want to change the pin code, you can use the 'chgpin' command.

  > chgpin 4321 (change primary pin code to 4321)
  > chgpin 4321 2 (same as aboce but for secondary pin code)

- If you want the card to return to the not-logged-in state, use the
  'forget' command.

  > forget (tell the sim card to logout the session)

- You can configure the sim card to not require the pin, by using the
  'reqpin1' command followed by 0 (to disable the need for a pin code) 
  or 1 (to require it) followed by the pin code.

  > reqpin1 0 1234 (disable the pin code)
  > reqpin1 1 1234 (require the pin code)

- If a pin has been blocked by too many wrong attempts, may want to unblock 
  it using the puk code. Per default you will manage the pin1 code.

  > unblockpin 1 1234 654654 (reset primary pin code using 654654 puk code)
  > unblockpin 2 1234 654654 (same as above but for pin2)

- If you want to read the content of your phone book from your sim card and
  store it to a file on your computer, you need to use the 'read' command.
  You'll need to specify the filename of the file where the phone book will
  be saved.
  You can also specify if you want to export all records (0) or only
  non-empty records (1).

  > read myfile 0 (export all records to myfile)
  > read myfile 1 (export only non-empty records to myfile)

- If you want to (over-) write the sim phone book using a file, you can
  use the 'write' command.
  computer filesystem to your sim card, you need to use the 'write' command
  and to specify the filename of the file from which phonebook will be read.
  You can also specify if you want to write all records (0) or only used
  ones (1).

  > write myfile 0 (overwrite all records given in the file)
  > write myfile 1 (import only non-empty records from the file)

- You can also use the 'class' command.
  This command takes a single byte in hexadecimal to specify the ISO7816
  command class for taking to the sim card.
  This should only be necessary for some really old cards (pre 2000).

  > class A0
